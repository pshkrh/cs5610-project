## Project Summary

In the modern era, a primary problem for many people is finding scrap shops or collectors to sell their scrap/waste. This process is often costly and time-consuming, as it involves locating a buyer for the scrap. Similarly, collectors also needed to find sellers to maintain their economic cycle.

We developed a web application to enhance conventional waste dealings by implementing a one-stop secured portal for garbage collectors and business owners. This portal, WasteDeal, includes a waste classifier, timely pickup mechanism, and provides appropriate waste rates. It enables classification of paper, metal, and plastic waste, among other obsolete items. Moreover, it assists waste collectors in finding profitable scrap buying deals.

**Approach**: We developed an interactive web application with three main modules: User, Garbage Collector, and Admin. Users can make pickup requests with details like scrap type, weight, and address. These requests are forwarded directly to the collectors in their region. Collectors then collect the waste and compensate the users, while the admin deals directly with the collectors. For the front-end, we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and Redux. The backend was built with Node.js, and MongoDB was chosen for the database. Upon completion, the web application frontend was deployed to Netlify and the backend was deployed to Render.

**Technology Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Node.js, Redux, MongoDB, JWT, Netlify, Render

**User Types**: There are three primary users of the portal.

- **Users**: People looking to sell their waste/scrap/garbage to collectors.
- **Collectors**: Individuals who collected waste from users and reported to the admin/owner. They acted as mediators between users and the admin/owner.
- **Admins/Owners**: The people who owned the portal. The owner dealt with waste collectors.
